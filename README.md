# Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creating using PowerBI)
## Project Objective
The aim of this project is to analyze electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends, usage patterns, and performance metrics to support data-driven decision-making for stakeholders, including manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers.

## Dataset Used 
https://github.com/Gmanas7735/EV_Project/blob/main/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.xlsx

## Questions (KPIs)
-	Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
-	Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.
-	Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.
-	Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.
-	Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in the dataset.
-	Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.

##Process
-	Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same using power query.
-	Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, date format and values used.
-	Remove unwanted fields/columns.
-	Add some measure  help for using visualization like:-(Total EV, % of BEV, % of PHEV, Average electric range)
